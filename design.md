Participatory tools of music production of the future  should feature the following:

- Need to be readily available, accessible, and run on batteries. Mobile phones and/or tablets are an obvious choice.
- Need to allow local sounds to be incorporated – so there is a choice to avoid reliance on Yamaha or whoever.
- Need to allow for local music structures, arrangements.
- Need to be legal (as opposed to the widespread adoption of pirated software as is the case currently).
- Need to be owned collectively, so that a single entity, person, organisation or company is not in control (so open source would make sense)
- Need to be easy to use so that it is genuinely participatory – as opposed to a lot of current software which is really aimed at musicians or those adept at using computers.
- People should be able to play together and make music collaboratively
