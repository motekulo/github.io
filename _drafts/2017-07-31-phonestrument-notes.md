# The Story

Two track, and the idea of people using phones for music. the idea of a more elaborate instrument for music production.

Tone js - on advice from CENMAT, Adrian Freed

Started with older versio of nexus ui
Added Nexus UI - nexusosc.

Now it's https://nexus-js.github.io/ui/

Essentially sought to see that what would be needed in an instrument for a phone would be doable; so recording, saving and sharing as an mp3.

Mobile phones and music in Melanesia - always linked, interest around spread of phones in PNG in particular, and how that has changed what is going on with music in such places.

Various research questions, meetings, and responses.

"The last thing we need is another four track studio in an app - there's lots of those already". Got thinking about that in more detail.

## Research questions
What are people doing on phones - musically, that is?
What applications exist already?

Android as a focus for my work - due to its ubiquity in the Global South.

Easy to redo older "traditional" forms of interface and interaction - the tracker, the sequencer, the multitrack recorder. One of the arguments I am making though, is that as software mediates more and more musical activity globally - so across more diverse musics - so perhaps should interfaces be more diverse. Or at least the opportunity for diversity.

So, while UIs like nexus are incredibly functional and useful when one emerges from a particular trajectory of music technology (the dominant one), might there be other ways?

This has lead to a series of experiments with a game engine - Phaser - and how this might connect with ways of making music. Ironically, in relation to the grant I am working on, I want the music to be reasonably relevant, and in this case that means a particular kind of Melanesian popular music (pop/rock) with strong elements of rock, pop, and reggae, in local languages. So tonal, 4/4. What I hope to achieve, however, are broader ideas about how diffferent elements (UI and music engine) might connect that opens greater diversity.

this exists to some extend wih things like Pd and Max.

Somewhere something about the importance of open source in all of this (separate post maybe?).
