# The site
This site is devoted to discussion, ideas, reviews and news about making music on mobile phones. The main focus is Android, as that’s where my usage and development experience lies, but if others want to contribute from other platforms, contact me.

# Me

I’m a music lecturer at Macquarie University, and write music production apps for Android phones in my spare time (http://www.motekulo.net).  I’m a keen user of music production apps on phones and tablets, and my research is increasingly examining the growing world of participatory culture (or what Google are calling Gen C).
