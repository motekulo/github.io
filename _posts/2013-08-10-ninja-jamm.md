This [remixing/editing](http://ninjajamm.com/) app looks like heaps of fun. [Create digital](http://createdigitalmusic.com/2013/04/beyond-listening-ninja-tune-launches-ninja-jamm-opens-artists-to-mobile-remix-cdm-exclusive/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+createdigitalmusic+(createdigitalmusic.com)) has an excellent description and discussion about it.

It uses [pdlib](http://gitorious.org/pdlib), an open source library allowing developers to incorporate patches from [Puredata](http://puredata.info/) into their apps. Check out this Pd patch screenshot from the app:

An android port is coming soon apparently; can’t wait! This kind of collaboration between a record label and arts studio [Seeper](http://seeper.com/) is really exciting. I’m really interested in the space for simpler apps with a wider  potential user base/audience (the two are merging/the same?!).
