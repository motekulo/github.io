After some modifications to my homemade iRig (aRig?) that added the headphones as well, I decided to try recording directly from the Meeblip to the phone, then overdub some guitar as a proof of concept more than anything. I sequenced a bass line on the laptop, then played this back through my the Meeblip, with its audio out to the phone:

Then bounced this down to the stereo track and overdubbed some guitar. The latency issue took lots of mucking around with the settings in [Twotrack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.motekulo.twotrack&hl=en), so I definitely need to add a nudge “feature” to it:

And then bounced it and shared it to [Box.net](http://www.box.net/). I added the share facility on the weekend, but need to tweak it as only Box.net seems to work at the moment with the way I’m coding it. Getting there though…
