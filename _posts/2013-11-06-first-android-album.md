Coolout (Christopher Davis) has had an [album](http://cooloutmusic.com/album/the-rise) out for a couple of years now that used Android apps exclusively, or as the site describes:

“All sounds created and vocals recorded through an Android cell phone”

The workflow is discussed in an article at [Create Digital Music](http://createdigitalmusic.com/2011/04/an-all-android-hip-hop-album-and-the-tools-used-to-create-it/).

There’s a statement of support from Andy Rubin (VP at Google Mobile at the time)! Well worth a listen, and the start of more of this sort of production I hope.
