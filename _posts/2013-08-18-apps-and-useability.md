Most people use their thumbs. I read a [great post](http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/08/5-tips-for-creating-great-mobile-app-user-interfaces/) this morning that points out some really significant useabilty things to consider. Designing apps that are fun and effective to use is really important for music production so seeing where it’s easiest on the screen for people to move to is really valuable. Check out this diagram from that post about ease of screen access when using thumbs:

I’ve been watching users more and more on my commute and walk to work, and that seems to be the case. I’m also reading [User-Centered Design by Travis Lowdermilk](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028741.do) - an O’Reilly book – which is a really useful reminder to involve users more and more throughout the design process. The plan is to incorporate these ideas into future updates and apps.
