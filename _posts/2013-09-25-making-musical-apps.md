Peter Brinkmann has written an excellent book titled Making Musical Apps ([Oâ€™Reilly, Amazon](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022503.do)), that covers developing on iOS and Android using the [Pdlib](https://github.com/libpd) library, which uses the versatile [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/) as a backend. Highly recommended for anyone interested in writing apps to make music.
