Peter Brinkmann’s latest contribution to audio on the Android platform is [Patchfield](http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/patchfield-for-android.html), an open source library allowing inter-application audio routing. This is a really important development, and although I’ve yet to look into the library in more detail or try coding anything, it offers great potential for the platform to emerge as a more serious contender for music production.

There’s also a really interesting interview with Peter [here](http://designingsound.org/2013/09/interview-peter-brinkmann-libpd/) about libpd in general.
