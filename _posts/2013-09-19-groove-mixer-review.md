[Groovemixer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flexbyte.groovemixer&hl=en) is the second  result on Google Play when searching for “drum machine”. It has had over 500 000 downloads, and has a great rating of 4.2. It is Ad supported with the option to buy a version with no ads. The app starts with a splash screen with details for forthcoming releases, and a link to a [tutorial website](http://groovemixer.com/tutorials/).

You need to load up samples before making any beats, which might put off the very impatient but the samples are good and it stays in time. It has an effective sequencer, allowing complex combinations of beats to be built up.

The mixing capabilities are extensive, for both sequencer and drum samples, with  panning, and solo and mute buttons.

Finally, along with being able to save existing projects, there is an export to wav file and share to soundcloud facility, which is really useful. There are some pretty small touch targets (particularly to scroll the sequencer window) and it has some quirks, but there’s a reason it has been downloaded so many times and has such a good rating – it’s a really useful and fully featured app.
